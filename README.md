# Modelling the Impact of Increased Atmospheric CO2 on Marine Plankton


A project utilizing the 'EcoGENIE' software to model the impact of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations due to anthropogenically-driven global warming on marine plankton communities


Project Description:

This is an upload of a assignment at university I undertook, which involved the use of the EcoGENIE model provided by the ECOGEM software package. This model provided the options to create and modify a number of different abiotic and biotic factors which could be decreased or increased according to input data, and a number of features allowed modelling of less or more complex interactions within these. The focus of this project was to develop a model which would provide some insight into the impact of changing atmospheric CO2 levels due to human activity, as plankton, at the base of the oceanic food chain are one of the most important groups to understand when we consider how our oceans will likely change in the future.

This project compared the projected impacts this model allowed on marine plankton communities of a worst-case climate-change scenario compared against situations of lesser or no change to atmospheric CO2. This model predicted significant changes within the marine plankton community broadly in line with similar studies carried out within the associated scientific literature, which will inevitably have negative consequences to larger global ecosystems. I also provide visualizations of the data, as well as an overview of the modelling process and its inherent limitations.




Brief scientific Overview:

Briefly, 8 phytoplankton size classes are introduced. The effects of water temperature, nutrient uptake, photosynthesis and zooplankton grazing pressure are regulated to different degrees according to size class. The 8 different zooplankton classes are also distinguished in respiration rate, temperature limitation and grazing rate. Top-down zooplankton control also differs according to food source availability. Organic matter in the water column results from imperfect assimilation by zooplankton, and phytoplankton and zooplankton mortality, and is remineralized instantly. The full alterations to the EcoGENIE model provided by the ECOGEM package are described by Ward et al. (2018). The RCP 8.5 scenario utilized in this model is sourced from a series of greenhouse gas emission projections described by Moss et al. (2010). Out of these, the RCP 8.5 scenario represents the pathway with the highest relative greenhouse gas emissions scenario. The use of ‘worst-case scenario’ projections here is used because it should result in the most extreme and therefore most easily identifiable changes in plankton community composition.
